// Write a function called “getIndexOf”.

// Given a character and a string, “getIndexOf” returns the first position of the given character in the given string.

// Notes:
// * Strings are zero indexed, meaning the first character in a string is at position 0.
// * When a string contains more than one occurrence of a character, it should return the index of its first occurrence.
// * If the character does not exist in the string, it should return -1.
// * Do not use the native indexOf function in your implementation.

getIndexOf = (char, str) => {
    for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
        if (char === str[i]) {
            return i
        }
    }
    return -1
}

console.log(getIndexOf("p", "Aquis"))
